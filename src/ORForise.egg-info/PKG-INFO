# ORForise - Prokaryote Genome Annotation Comparison and Analysis Platform

Platform for analysing Prokaryote Protein Coding Gene Predictors. Novel genome annotations can be compared to Gold
Standard annotations from Ensembl (or any given GFF annotation) and predictions from other tools.

## Requirements and Installation:

The ORForise platform is written in Python3 and only requires the Numpy library which is standard in most base
installations of Python3.

### Platform Preparation

First step is to clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/NickJD/ORForise'

To run, you need:

* Input Genome FASTA and corresponding GFF file with the annotated genes for the genome you want to compare to.
* A prediction output from one of the compatible tools for the same genome (New tools can be added).

Each tool requires its own directory and prediction output must be named as follows '~toolName/toolName_Species.*'

### How to add your own Genome:

Each prediction tool has a directory and data handling script which converts the different tool output into a dictionary
that ORForise understands.  
New genomes and tools can be added to the analysis but they must follow the same directory and naming structure as
originals. To add a new genome, simply place the .fa and .gff files in the Genomes directory - Make sure the filename
before the '.' is the same for both files.

### How to add your own tool:

If the new tool reports its predictions in GFF you can put the new tools output in the GFF directory. If another format
is used, you must make another directory for that tool and reproduce the '~GFF/GFF.py' script so that ORForise knows how
to extracting the ORF predictions.

## ORF Prediction Analysis:

### Use-cases:

For Help: python3 ORForise.py -h

```python
usage: ORForise.py [-h] -t TOOL [-p PARAMETERS] -g GENOME_TO_COMPARE

arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t TOOL, --tool TOOL  Which tool to analyse?
  -p PARAMETERS, --parameters PARAMETERS
                        Optional parameters for prediction tool.
  -g GENOME_TO_COMPARE, --genome_to_compare GENOME_TO_COMPARE
                        Which genome to analyse? Genome files have same prefix - .fa and .gff appended
```

Output = "'tool'_'genome_to_compare'.csv"

### Compare a novel genome annotation to an Ensembl Gold Standard:

Genome annotation is a difficult process, 'even for Prokaryotes'. ORForise allows the direct and systematic analysis of
a novel ORF prediction from a wide selection of tools to a Gold Standard Genome Annotation, such as those provided by
Ensembl Bacteria.

#### Example: python3 ORForise.py -t Prodigal -g E-coli

#### Example with Model Parameter: python3 ORForise.py -t GeneMark -p Staph -g Staph

### Compare different novel annotations with each other on a single Genome:

If a Gold Standard Genome Annotation is not available or a direct comparison between two or more tools is wanted,
ORForise can be used as the example below.

#### Example: python3 ORForise.py -t Prodigal -g E-coli_FragGeneScan

This will compare the novel Prodigal predictions against the predictions made by FragGeneScan (Note: For this example,
the ~Genomes directory has both E-coli_FragGeneScan.fa and ~.gff files to allow the comparison)

## GFF Tools:

### GFF_Adder:

GFF_Adder allows for the addition of predicted ORFs to an existing GFF which produces a new GFF containing the original
genes plus the new ORFs from another prediction. Default filtering to remove additional ORFs that overlap existing genes
by more than 50 nt.

For Help: python3 GFF_Adder.py -h

```python

usage: GFF_Adder.py [-h] -g GENOME -t TOOL [-p PARAMETERS] [-olap OVERLAP] -o OUTPUT_FILE

optional arguments:
  -h, --help      show this help message and exit
  -g GENOME       Which genome to use as Gold Standard?
  -t TOOL         While tool to add to Gold Standard Annotation?
  -p PARAMETERS   Optional parameters for prediction tool.
  -olap OVERLAP   maximum overlap between Gene and ORF
  -o OUTPUT_FILE  output filename

```

### GFF_Intersector:

GFF_Intersector enables the aggregation of different genome annotations/ORF predictions and creates a single GFF
representing the intersection of the two existing GFFs.

GFF_Intersector also provides an option to allow the retention of genes that have a user defined difference (minimum
75\% coverage and in-frame).

For Help: python3 GFF_Intersector.py -h

```python
usage: GFF_Intersector.py [-h] -g GENOME -t TOOL [-p PARAMETERS] [-cov COVERAGE] -o OUTPUT_FILE

optional arguments:
  -h, --help      show this help message and exit
  -g GENOME       Which genome to use as Gold Standard?
  -t TOOL         While tool to add to Gold Standard Annotation?
  -p PARAMETERS   Optional parameters for prediction tool.
  -cov COVERAGE   ORF coverage of Gene in percentage - Default of 100 means exact match
  -o OUTPUT_FILE  output filename

```
